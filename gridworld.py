This is where I will be making the stochastic gridworld environement. 

Environment mechanics: 
- start position -- this could be hardcoded but may also be worth looking into the idea of having the starting positions also stochastic
- goal position -- there will be many goals that are fairly easy to find, but they are not always there. They will stochastically happen.
